## Abstract

The next generation of high-accuracy positioning services is required to satisfy the sub-meter accuracy level for more than 95% of the network area, including indoor, outdoor, and urban deployments. In this vein, inter-agent measurements appear to provide additional position information and hence have the capacity to boost localization accuracy. This paper researches cooperative positioning techniques by means of device-to-device (D2D) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) technologies leveraging received signal strength (RSS) based ranging. In particular, the theoretical models for D2D- and RIS-aided positioning are provided, and the pros and cons of each method are discussed from both communication and localization perspectives. Numerical results reveal the use cases advantageous for RIS- and D2D-aided localization. Then, based on the results, valuable guidelines are derived on the optimal sensor fusion metric - median - that minimizes the mean error of the cooperative localization.
