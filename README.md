## Abstract

The next generation of high-accuracy positioning services is required to satisfy the sub-meter accuracy level for more than 95% of the network area, including indoor, outdoor, and urban deployments. In this vein, inter-agent measurements appear to provide additional position information and hence have the capacity to boost localization accuracy. This paper researches cooperative positioning techniques by means of device-to-device (D2D) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) technologies leveraging received signal strength (RSS) based ranging. In particular, the theoretical models for D2D- and RIS-aided positioning are provided, and the pros and cons of each method are discussed from both communication and localization perspectives. Numerical results reveal the use cases advantageous for RIS- and D2D-aided localization. Then, based on the results, valuable guidelines are derived on the optimal sensor fusion metric - median - that minimizes the mean error of the cooperative localization.

## Content of Code Package
1. [simulateFigure1.m](simulateFigure1.m) generates Fig. 1: SNR comparison of RIS and relays.

2. Fig. 2 is drawn in Inkscape:

![Fig. 2](figures/positioning_approaches.png)

3. [simulateFigure3.m](simulateFigure3.m) generates Fig. 3: LoS probability as a function of 2D distance between the BS and the MT according to 3GPP UMi Street Canyon model.


4. Fig. 4 is drawn in Inkscape:

![Fig. 4](figures/four_scenarios.png)

5. [simulateFigure5.m](simulateFigure5.m) generates Fig. 5:  Theoretical lower bounds, equal placement of RISs and relays. 

When running, select the folowing (equal placement of RISs and relays): Choose D2D user distribution? Options are 1,2,3,4: 3

6. [CRLB.m](CRLB.m) generates Table VI: Lower bounds, [m]. Results are shown in descending order of 95thPRC error. 

See instructions below for LoS scenario. This code generates theoretical lower bounds, such as Cramer–Rao
lower bound (CRLB), horizontal dilution of precision
(HDoP), and geometric weighted least square (G-WLS).

7. [simulateFigure6.m](simulateFigure6.m) generates Fig. 6:  Visualisation of Gaussian noise probability density function.

8. Fig. 7 is generated by running [mainCode.m](mainCode.m) and Fig. 7d is generated by running [mainCode_median.m](mainCode_median.m)

**Figure 7 and Table VII can be generatied by running the code with the parameters as explained in the instructions below, or by running the following script that reads saved data (pregenerated)**
