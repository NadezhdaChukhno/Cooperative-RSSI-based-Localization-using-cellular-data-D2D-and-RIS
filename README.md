## Abstract

The next generation of high-accuracy positioning services must satisfy the sub-meter accuracy level for more than 95% of the network area, including indoor, outdoor, and urban deployments. In this vein, inter-agent measurements appear to provide additional position information and hence have the capacity to boost localization accuracy. This paper researches cooperative positioning techniques by means of device-to-device (D2D) and reconfigurable intelligent surfaces (RIS) technologies using received signal strength (RSS) based ranging. In particular, we provide the theoretical models for D2D- and RIS-aided positioning. Then, we discuss the pros and cons of each of the two methods from communication and localization perspectives. Our numerical results reveal the use cases advantageous for RIS and D2D usage. Then, based on the results, we derive useful guidelines on the optimal sensor fusion metric - median - that minimizes the mean absolute error of the cooperative localization.
